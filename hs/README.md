# Playing with Haskell

* my first functional language
* was familar with Ruby's blocks before starting out with Haskell
* sadly, I don't know how I got in touch (but probably my old harddisk
  has a few clues...)
* learnt most things with [Learn You a Haskell][lyah] (2011)
* got in touch again in university (3rd semester), "new things" were
  more formal understanding (2012)
* Monads have evaded me so far, but I hope to become more familar with
  them (see [HelloMonads](./HelloMonads.hs) for that)

## Required reading

* [Learn You a Haskell][lyah]
* [Hoogle](http://haskell.org/hoogle)

## Notes

* my favourite things written in Haskell are:
    - [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net): a versatile document
      converter (mostly used for markdown, but also for html email
      viewing)
    - [XMonad](http://xmonad.org): A tiling window manager, plan to use
      it again. Is on the list of "programs to read".

## How To Learn

- write something that you wish existed
- play with the repl (Clojure excels at manipulating data, so take some data and play with it)
    - `doc` and `ns-publics` are your friends
- koans:
    - [4clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/)
    - ["Clojure Katas inspired by Alice in Wonderland"](https://github.com/gigasquid/wonderland-clojure-katas)
