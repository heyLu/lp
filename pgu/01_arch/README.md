# Programming from the ground up

Despite knowing about basic cpu architecture I have never actually
written any "real" assembler program. Here I aim to fix that. I
currently use the [Programming from the ground up][pgu-book] book, but
if you know anything similar that has helped you understand how a
computer works at the levels below C, please tell me.
