# Java can surprise you

I thought I knew Java, I'd written code in it for a few years now, but I
was *wrong*. While I was able to solve a problem in Java, I didn't
really understand it, I had just developed enough mental workarounds to
make it appear so.

With this little project, I'll try to remedy this a bit. I have to write
more Java now, and I'd like to be able to say "I know Java" with
confidence.

Recently, I came across an interesting idea: to start playing with a
language using unit tests, so as to test your understanding of the
language and practicing testing at the same time. So I'll try this style
of playing on for size.

## Open questions

* output arguments
* string immutability
* copying/passing objects and primitives (when is it a copy, when a
  reference)
