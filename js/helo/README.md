Pick a name and babble on to your hearts content.

    $ meteor
    [[[[[ ~/k/lp/js/helo ]]]]]

    => Meteor server running on: http://localhost:3000/

And [have fun](http://localhost:3000).

## Meteor

- quite fun to start
- db security: anyone can insert?
- must create custom meteor packages to use npm packages?
- no urls, no api: user/hacker hostile
- all-in-one package, mongodb bundled, nice start
    * probably well-suited for learning/teaching?
