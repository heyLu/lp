Playing around with [earthstar](https://earthstar-project.org/).  The in-beta v11 to make it
more "fun"/difficult.

## How to run this

- `bun build chat.js --outdir out` to build it
- `python -m http.server` for a simple server
- `deno run --allow-all server.js` to run the (non-working) sync server
