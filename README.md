# language playground

Hi there! Welcome to my little language playground. I use this
repository to help myself learning several programming languages, try
out ideas while also sharing the code with others.

So far I have written too much code that has never seen the light of
day, because it's in my *other* playground repository, which contains
all kinds of secrets and is thus not public. But I think it might be
valuable to share the experience of learning and playing with
programming languages. So here I am, enjoy yourself!

## Languages

* current:
    - [clojure](http://clojure.org): A modern Lisp on the JVM.
