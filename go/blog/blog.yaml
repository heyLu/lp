  content:
    Find infrequently used binaries on your system.  `ls --time=atime`
    is the key here, it uses the access time instead of the modification
    time, which is the default.

- title: Introduction
  content: |
    `blog` is a tiny tool that generates your (link)blog.
    It takes a [YAML](https://yaml.org) file as input, and produces
    a single HTML file on stdout, which you could then upload to your
    server, place on your Desktop, or pass along to friends.

    `blog` is not meant to be a feature-rich program.  It does the
    bare minimum necessary to host a blog with different post types,
    and not more.  Whichever additional features you need you can
    add to your version of it.

    ## How to use it

    All posts are written in a single file `blog.yaml`, which contains
    a list of entries.

    The most basic post type is `text`, written as follows:

        - title: An example post
          content: You can use *Markdown* here...

    Optionally you can specify a `date` field.

    If `content` starts with a non-alphabetic character, you need to
    start the value with a vertical bar `|`:

        - title: Special characters...
          content: |
            *This* post starts with a special character.

    There are a few other types of posts:

    * `shell`, similar to text, but `title` is a shell command
    * `link`, with an additional `url` field
    * `image`, where `url` is the source of an image
    * `song`, where `url` is the source of the song
    * `video`, where `url` is a link to a YouTube video

    With the exception of the `shell` type, `title` and `content`
    are optional.

- title: There are tags now!
  content: |
    You can now tag articles.  Any kind of string is allowed, have
    some fun with it...  :)

    Use them as follows:

        - # attributes as usual
          tags: [fancy, tags, "stuff:with-interesting!-characters"]

    Or alternatively:

        - # as usual
          tags:
            - fancy
            - tags
            - "stuff:with-interesting!-characters"

- title: Filters!  (More of them)
  content: |
    Let's write more filters.  Apart from the `tag` filter that we
    already have.

    Some ideas:

    - `title`: filter by text occurring in the title
    - `post`: filter a specific post by id (or multiple?)
    - `type`: filter by post type

    All of them will work similar to the existing `tag` filter, i.e.
    they can be used as links and will appear in the history.

    If we want to be fancy, we might implement combining filters using
    `and`.
