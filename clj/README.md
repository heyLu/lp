# Learning (aka. playing with) Clojure

- first heard about it early 2012 (I think)
- dipped my feet in a few times since then
- came across (i.e. read or saw things they did) a few interesting
  people using/writing Clojure in interesting way (fogus, Rich Hickey,
  Chris Granger)
- now reading 'The Joy of Clojure' (and enjoying it)

## Tools

- mostly LightTable
- previously Vim with the VimClojure plugin, but not right now
  (LightTable 'feels' more interactive to me and what I miss most from
  Vim (keybindings) will be in LT soonish, I also think that something
  like LT has more potential to be extensible and has a much saner
  extension language)
- the `clj` repl
