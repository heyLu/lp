# Learning (aka. playing with) Clojure

- first heard about it early 2012 (I think)
- dipped my feet in a few times since then
- came across (i.e. read or saw things they did) a few interesting
  people using/writing Clojure in interesting way (fogus, Rich Hickey,
  Chris Granger)
- now reading 'The Joy of Clojure' (and enjoying it)

## Tools

- mostly LightTable
- previously Vim with the VimClojure plugin, but not right now
  (LightTable 'feels' more interactive to me and what I miss most from
  Vim (keybindings) will be in LT soonish, I also think that something
  like LT has more potential to be extensible and has a much saner
  extension language)
- the `clj` repl

## Giggles & quibbles

+ the giggles
    * homoiconic
    * has macros
    * good feature inheritance (supposedly, not as in OO)
    * lots of cool projects (datomic, matchure, ring, lighttable,
      typed-clojure)
- the quibbles
    * the dynamic type-system continues to bite me
        could be my fault, but I often jump right in without reading the
        whole documentation and have spend too much time tracking weird
        errors down that were all fixed by changing one place in the
        code
    * the jvm overhead is bad for my little computer (too slow, too much
      memory consumed)
