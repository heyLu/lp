# Notes for The Joy of Clojure

Notes and Code regarding 'The Joy of Clojure'. The code is either
directly copied or directly inspired by the book. I'll add a note in
each file when the former is the case.

Regarding the copied code, I *think* that it's ok to use it, but I don't
know for sure. However, it *is* [availlable online][src], so I am
probably ok doing this. However, if you are Michael Fogus or Chris
Houser and don't like me copying the code here, please tell me and I'll
take it away.
