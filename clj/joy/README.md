# Notes for The Joy of Clojure

Notes and Code regarding 'The Joy of Clojure'. The code is either
directly copied or directly inspired by the book. I'll add a note in
each file when the former is the case.

Regarding the copied code, I *think* that it's ok to use it, but I don't
know for sure. However, it *is* [availlable online][src], so I am
probably ok doing this. However, if you are Michael Fogus or Chris
Houser and don't like me copying the code here, please tell me and I'll
take it away.

## Thoughts

Having just "finished" reading *The Joy of Clojure* for the first time,
here are a few thoughts about it (and me reading it).

* was to lazy reading it (didn't experiment much w/ types, protocols and
  the reference types (i.e. nothing in addition to shame.clj))
* the final chapter (especially the dsl example) was the most
  interesting to me (combination of interesting topic +
  interesting/intriguing example)
* overall, either there were not enough "real" examples or (quite
  likely) I should have played with it more (especially for the topics
  mentioned above re. lazyness)
* I *think* it was a good book, but it didn't meet my expectations of it
  being a constantly enlightening and delighting book (then again,
  playing with clojure often is and I should have done that while
  reading the book, I might have to reread the chapters with new stuff
  in it)
